explaining the project, dataset, and steps taken and insights

**Project Explanation:**
 
  In this project, we created Linear Regression Model and Ridge Regression Model on a coffee shop revenue dataset. We calculated MSE and R^2 values for both models and compared them to figure out which model has better performance. We implemented k-fold Cross-Validation to evaluate both models and reduce variance in performance estimates. Moreover, we further experimented the Ridge Regression Model by using different Alpha values to figure out the most suitable Alpha value. Lastly, we discussed practical applications on which model is better under different circumstances.
  
**Dataset Explanation:**
  
  The dataset we chose is a dataset detailing a coffee shop's daily revenue using many different independent variables (predictors), including Number_of_Customers_Per_Day, Average_Order_Value, Operating_Hours_Per_Day, Number_of_Employees, Marketing_Spend_Per_Day, and Location_Foot_Traffic. Daily_Revenue is our dependent variable (target).

**Insights**

1. Ridge Regression Model prevented overfitting in our dataset.
2. Linear Regression Model is more suitable for small datasets, where the relationship between variables is simple and few features comparing with the number of data provided.
3. Ridge Regression Model is more suitable for dataset with a lot of independent variables, and overfitting is a concern (the model fits the training data too well but performs poorly on new data).
